### Need to deploy to GitHub page
1. Fork this repository
2. Enable github-action repository page -> Actions -> Enable
3. Add token permissions: Repository page -> Setting -> Action -> General -> Workflow permissions -> Click Read and write permissions
4. Set page: Repository page -> Setting -> Pages -> Build and deployment -> Source set to Github Actions
5. Put your obsidian notes under example (or copy or link)
6. After each change, push directly to GitHub to automatically trigger the deployment process of the GitHub page
### Only need to generate static files, no need to deploy
> This is only applicable to linux (because the author is using a linux system)
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `init.sh` to download mdbook and obsidian-export. This step defaults to downloading the linux version. If you need another system version, please download it yourself
3. Run `create.sh <path to your repository>`, at this point the generated book folder is the required static file, you can deploy it on your own server
